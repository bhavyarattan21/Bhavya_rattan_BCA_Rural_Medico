            <p6>Vitamins and supplements boost health</p6>
          
            </div>
            <section>
                <h2>Vitamins and Supplements</h2>

                <p>Vitamins are organic compounds that our bodies use, in very small amounts, for a variety of metabolic processes. It is best to get vitamins and minerals from eating a variety of healthy unprocessed foods.</p>
            
                <p>While taking a general ‚Äòbroad-spectrum‚Äô vitamin and mineral supplement ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô poses little health risk, and may benefit a person whose diet is restricted and lacks variety, taking vitamin and mineral supplements instead of eating a nutritious diet is not recommended.</p>
            
                <p>Vitamin and mineral supplements are frequently misused and taken without professional advice. They are often used as a form of medicine to treat ailments such as colds, or to counteract lifestyle issues such as stress.</p>
            
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, vitamins aren‚Äôt drugs or miracle cures. They are organic compounds that participate in various metabolic functions. High-dose supplements should not be taken unless recommended under medical advice.</p>
            
                <h2>Vitamins and minerals are obtained from food</h2>
            
                <p>Research indicates that most of the vitamins you get from the food you eat are better than those contained in pills. Even though vitamins in supplements are synthesized to the exact chemical composition of naturally-occurring vitamins, they still don‚Äôt seem to work as well.</p>
            
                <p>The main exception to this is folate. The synthetic form (in a supplement or fortified food) is better absorbed by the body than folate from food sources.</p>
            
                <p>Food is a complex source of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals (plant chemicals), which all work together. Supplements tend to work in isolation. Research shows a food component that has an effect on the body may not have the same effect when it is isolated and taken as a supplement.</p>
            
                <p>Phytochemicals are an important component of food and are thought to reduce the incidence of heart disease and some cancers. Supplements do not provide the benefits of phytochemicals and other components found in food. Taking vitamin and mineral supplements is no substitute for a healthy diet.</p>
            
                <h2>Vitamin and mineral deficiencies</h2>
            
                <p>Our body only needs a small amount of vitamins and minerals every day. A varied diet generally provides enough of each vitamin and mineral. However, some people may need supplements to correct vitamin or mineral deficiencies and this includes:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding</li>
                    <li>people who smoke, drink alcohol in excess or use illegal drugs</li>
                    <li>crash dieters or those on very strict diets</li>
                    <li>the elderly (especially those who are disabled or chronically ill)</li>
                    <li>some vegetarians or vegans</li>
                    <li>women with heavy periods</li>
                    <li>people with food allergies</li>
                    <li>those with malabsorption problems (such as diarrhoea, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis)</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Folate and pregnancy</h2>
            
                <p>Women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy are recommended folic acid (also known as folate) supplements to reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.</p>
            
                <p>Folic acid is a B-group vitamin which can also be found in some fortified foods such as breads and breakfast cereals.</p>
            
                <h2>Vegan diets and vitamin supplements</h2>
            
                <p>People who follow vegan diets, especially if pregnant, may benefit from vitamin B12 supplements. This is because B12 is only found in animal products.</p>
            
                <h2>Vitamin pills are not miracle cures</h2>
            
                <p>It is commonly believed that taking mega-doses of certain vitamins will act like medicine to cure or prevent certain ailments. For instance, vitamin C is suggested as a cure for the common cold, and vitamin E is widely promoted as a beneficial antioxidant to help prevent heart disease.</p>
            
                <p>After extensive research, however, neither of these claims has been shown to be true. Large-scale studies have consistently shown little benefit in taking mega-doses of supplements. In fact, there is some evidence that taking high-dose supplements to prevent or cure major chronic diseases may be harmful to your health.</p>
            
                <h2>Stress, tiredness and vitamin pills</h2>
            
                <p>Vitamin supplements are commonly considered to be an antidote to stress. Feeling under pressure doesn‚Äôt automatically lead to a vitamin deficiency, so taking a vitamin supplement won‚Äôt necessarily make stressful feelings go away.</p>
            
                <p>Popping a pill will not likely cure persistent tiredness either. If you are feeling run down, it is more likely to be due to stress, depression, insufficient sleep or other factors, rather than a vitamin deficiency. If you feel like this regularly, seek medical advice.</p>
            
                <h2>Anti-ageing vitamins</h2>
            
                <p>Vitamin E is often singled out as the potential fountain of youth. However, there is no evidence that taking large doses of any vitamin can stall or reverse the effects of ageing. Neither can one vitamin restore a flagging sex drive or cure infertility.</p>
            
                <h2>Vitamin use and cancer claims</h2>
            
                <p>Some claims have been made that certain vitamins can treat different cancers. However, research shows this is not the case. For example:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamin A (beta-carotene) in large doses does not cure cancer and can be toxic, particularly if taken as pills rather than food.</li>
                    <li>Although there is some evidence vitamin E could play a small role in preventing some cancers, there is also evidence it could speed up the onset of other types of cancer. However, this has not been proved or disproved.</li>
                    <li>High doses of antioxidants are unlikely to help with the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatments. In fact, megadoses of antioxidants can interfere with some medical treatments for cancer.</li>
                    <li>Some studies have shown prostate, breast, and lung cancer risk are not decreased by taking high-dose supplements containing vitamins E or C or selenium.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Vitamin and mineral supplements can be dangerous</h2>
            
                <p>Proper balance and adequate levels of essential nutrients is important for a range of complex processes in our body. When vitamins are taken as supplements, they are introduced into the body at levels that could never be achieved by eating even the healthiest of diets.</p>
            
                <p>Supplementation can also result in large doses of a single vitamin being eaten ‚Äòalone.‚Äô When vitamins are consumed from foods, they have many companions to help them along the way. For instance, provitamin A (beta-carotene) in food is accompanied by hundreds of its carotenoid relatives.</p>
            
                <p>Simply taking a vitamin pill is not an instant fix for feeling run down or lacking in energy. It is the combination of a whole range of compounds in foods that gives us the protection.</p>
            
                <p>Vitamin and mineral supplements can also interfere with prescription medicines and medical treatments. In extreme cases, for example, where people take 100 times the recommended dietary intake (RDI), this can stop the work of anticonvulsant drugs, such as those used in epilepsy.</p>
